<!-- Fragmant Conventions
- Always use the addDependent method to integrate the fragment into the control tree of the view.
- Private functions and variables should always start with an underscore.

	<!--
	The term begin indicates that this button should be displayed before the content of the endButton aggregation. 
	We use the terms begin and end as a synonym to “left” and “right", but in right-to-left mode for specific languages the order is switched.
