    <title>SAPUI5 Best Practice App for Ciber</title>

        src="/beta-resources/sap-ui-core.js"

    <!-- 
    Your application should live inside a namespace. This sample application's identifier is "bestpracticeapp",
    within the "de.ciber" namespace, thus the name de.ciber.bestpracticeapp is the fully qualified identifier for this application.
    This name is used in two places in the index file:
        - in the bootstrap's data-sap-ui-resourceroots data parameter
        - in the specification of the Component to load into the sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer
    Pairing a namespace and folder location in the data-sap-ui-resourceroots declares where artifacts with that namespace can be found. 
    In this example we are saying that the artifacts starting "de.ciber.bestpracticeapp" are to be found in the same folder ("./") as this index file.
    When the component is specified with the name property of the sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer, it is by means of the "de.ciber.bestpracticeapp" namespace. 
    By default, the container will look for a component called "Component" in this namespace, which thus translates to de.ciber.bestpracticeapp.Component. 
    This will be found in the file Component.js in the same folder, because we've specified this same folder as being where resources in the de.ciber.bestpracticeapp namespace are to be found.
	-->
    <!--
    Conventions
    - The component is named Component.js.
    - The descriptor file is named manifest.json.
    - Together with all assets of the app, these files are located in the app folder.
    - The index.html file is located outside of the webapp folder.
